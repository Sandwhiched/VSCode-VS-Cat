# VS Cat

## Features

- Adds the `meow` command to make the VS Cat speak. For when you forget what your boss told you what to do and are bored.
- Adds the `feed` command so the VS Cat doesn't start nibbling your code bytes.

## Known Issues

None so far! I try to do rigorous testing on my extensions to find any issues. If you find one, post it at my GitHub repo!
